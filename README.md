This repository contains PDF files and source code and other educational resources for
Informatics Club (2024) of Taipei Wego Private Senior High School.  
  
This course is designed for beginners that have no or little knowledge about C++ and general programming.  
All code is written in competitive programming style C++.  
  
### Files  
  
Source files and PDF files are classified by week (however, the real course did not really follow the schedule)  
In each folder, there are PDF(s) and C++ source code used for demonstration. 
Some of the PDFs also include coding practices for students to try.

The [Contest](./Contest) folder holds validator, checker, solution, and generator files for [Codeforces Polygon contests](https://polygon.codeforces.com)
